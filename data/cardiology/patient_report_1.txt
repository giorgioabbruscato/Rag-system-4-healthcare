CARDIOLOGY CONSULTATION REPORT

Patient: John Smith (ID: 12345)
Date: January 15, 2024
Attending Physician: Dr. Sarah Johnson, MD FACC

CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Shortness of breath and lower extremity swelling for 3 weeks

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
67-year-old male with history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes presents with progressive dyspnea on exertion and bilateral lower extremity edema over the past 3 weeks. Patient reports orthopnea (requires 3 pillows to sleep) and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Denies chest pain, palpitations, or syncope. Reports 8-pound weight gain over this period.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
- Hypertension (15 years)
- Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (10 years)
- Hyperlipidemia
- Former smoker (quit 5 years ago, 30 pack-year history)

MEDICATIONS:
- Lisinopril 20 mg daily
- Metformin 1000 mg twice daily
- Atorvastatin 40 mg daily
- Aspirin 81 mg daily

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Vital Signs: BP 145/92 mmHg, HR 98 bpm, RR 22, O2 Sat 92% on room air, Temp 98.6°F
General: Alert, oriented, in mild respiratory distress
Cardiovascular: Regular rhythm, S3 gallop present, JVP elevated at 12 cm, no murmurs
Pulmonary: Bilateral basilar crackles
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no hepatomegaly
Extremities: 2+ pitting edema bilaterally to mid-shin level

DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:

Electrocardiogram:
- Sinus rhythm at 98 bpm
- Left ventricular hypertrophy
- No acute ST-T wave changes

Chest X-ray:
- Cardiomegaly
- Bilateral pulmonary vascular congestion
- Small bilateral pleural effusions

Echocardiogram:
- Left ventricular ejection fraction: 30%
- Moderate left ventricular dilation
- Global hypokinesis
- Mild mitral regurgitation
- Estimated right ventricular systolic pressure: 45 mmHg

Laboratory Results:
- BNP: 890 pg/mL (normal <100)
- Troponin I: 0.02 ng/mL (negative)
- Creatinine: 1.4 mg/dL (baseline 1.1)
- eGFR: 52 mL/min/1.73m²
- Sodium: 136 mEq/L
- Potassium: 4.2 mEq/L
- Hemoglobin: 12.8 g/dL

ASSESSMENT:
New-onset heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), NYHA Class III

Likely etiology: Ischemic vs. hypertensive cardiomyopathy

PLAN:
1. Initiate guideline-directed medical therapy:
   - Start carvedilol 3.125 mg twice daily, titrate as tolerated
   - Continue lisinopril, monitor renal function and potassium
   - Add furosemide 40 mg daily for diuresis
   - Start spironolactone 25 mg daily (potassium and renal function permitting)

2. Dietary modifications:
   - Sodium restriction to <2 g/day
   - Daily weight monitoring
   - Fluid restriction to 1.5-2 L/day

3. Further evaluation:
   - Consider coronary angiography to evaluate for ischemic etiology
   - Optimize diabetes and blood pressure control

4. Follow-up:
   - Recheck labs (BMP, BNP) in 1 week
   - Cardiology follow-up in 2 weeks
   - Repeat echocardiogram in 3 months after optimization of medical therapy

5. Patient education:
   - Signs and symptoms of worsening HF
   - Medication compliance
   - Lifestyle modifications
   - When to seek emergency care

PROGNOSIS:
Discussed with patient the chronic nature of heart failure and importance of medication adherence and lifestyle modifications. With optimal medical therapy, symptoms should improve.
