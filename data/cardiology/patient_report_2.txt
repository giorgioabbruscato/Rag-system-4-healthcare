CARDIOLOGY CONSULTATION REPORT

Patient: Mary Williams (ID: 67890)
Date: February 3, 2024
Attending Physician: Dr. Michael Chen, MD FACC

CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Chest pain with exertion

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
58-year-old female presents with 2-month history of substernal chest pressure occurring with moderate exertion (walking uphill, climbing stairs). Pain resolves with rest after 5-10 minutes. No associated shortness of breath, nausea, or diaphoresis. No symptoms at rest. Patient concerned about recent family history of premature coronary artery disease (brother had MI at age 52).

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
- Hypertension
- Hyperlipidemia
- Postmenopausal (age 52)
- Family history of CAD

MEDICATIONS:
- Amlodipine 5 mg daily
- Rosuvastatin 20 mg daily

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Vital Signs: BP 138/84 mmHg, HR 72 bpm, RR 16, O2 Sat 98% on room air
General: Well-appearing, no distress
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops, normal S1/S2
Pulmonary: Clear to auscultation bilaterally
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender
Extremities: No edema, pulses 2+ throughout

DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:

Electrocardiogram:
- Normal sinus rhythm at 72 bpm
- No ST-T wave abnormalities
- No pathological Q waves

Exercise Stress Test:
- Bruce protocol: 7 minutes, 8 METS
- Stopped due to chest pain and fatigue
- Maximum heart rate: 142 bpm (87% of predicted)
- Peak BP: 168/88 mmHg
- 1.5 mm horizontal ST depression in leads V4-V6 at peak exercise
- Chest pain reproduced during test, resolved in recovery
- Interpretation: Positive for inducible ischemia

Laboratory Results:
- Total cholesterol: 198 mg/dL
- LDL: 118 mg/dL
- HDL: 58 mg/dL
- Triglycerides: 110 mg/dL
- Hemoglobin A1c: 5.6%
- Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL

ASSESSMENT:
Stable angina pectoris, Canadian Cardiovascular Society Class II
Positive stress test concerning for obstructive coronary artery disease

PLAN:
1. Medical management:
   - Start aspirin 81 mg daily
   - Start metoprolol succinate 25 mg daily
   - Continue rosuvastatin, goal LDL <70 mg/dL
   - Continue amlodipine for blood pressure control
   - Initiate sublingual nitroglycerin as needed for chest pain

2. Diagnostic evaluation:
   - Coronary angiography recommended given positive stress test
   - Discussed risks and benefits with patient
   - Patient agrees to proceed

3. Risk factor modification:
   - Dietary counseling (Mediterranean diet)
   - Regular exercise program (cardiac rehabilitation referral)
   - Optimize blood pressure control (goal <130/80 mmHg)
   - Continue statin therapy

4. Follow-up:
   - Schedule coronary angiography within 2 weeks
   - Follow-up after procedure to discuss results and further management

CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHY RESULTS (performed February 15, 2024):
- Left main: Normal
- LAD: 70% stenosis in mid-segment
- LCx: 40% stenosis in proximal segment (non-obstructive)
- RCA: 30% stenosis in mid-segment (non-obstructive)
- Left ventriculography: Normal LV function, EF 60%

INTERVENTION:
- Successful drug-eluting stent placement to mid-LAD lesion
- Excellent angiographic result
- No complications

POST-PROCEDURE PLAN:
1. Dual antiplatelet therapy:
   - Aspirin 81 mg daily (indefinitely)
   - Ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily (minimum 12 months)

2. Continue medical therapy:
   - Metoprolol succinate 25 mg daily
   - Rosuvastatin 20 mg daily
   - Amlodipine 5 mg daily

3. Cardiac rehabilitation enrollment

4. Follow-up in 1 month for assessment and medication titration

PROGNOSIS:
Excellent prognosis with successful revascularization and optimal medical therapy. Patient counseled on importance of medication adherence, particularly dual antiplatelet therapy, and lifestyle modifications.
