**Typical features**

* Dilated left ventricle with **global systolic dysfunction** on echocardiography
* Reduced contractility involving most or all segments rather than a focal pattern
* Possible dilation of other chambers (left atrium, sometimes right ventricle)
* Functional (secondary) mitral and/or tricuspid regurgitation due to annular dilation
* Decreased stroke volume and cardiac output; low-flow state may be present
* Clinically often associated with symptoms of heart failure (exertional dyspnea, fatigue, fluid retention), though presentation can vary
* May show signs of elevated filling pressures on Doppler parameters, without a single defining marker

**Common differential diagnoses**

* Ischemic cardiomyopathy (especially with multivessel disease causing diffuse dysfunction)
* Hypertensive heart disease in a late, decompensated phase
* Valvular cardiomyopathy from chronic severe regurgitation
* Myocarditis (acute or chronic inflammatory patterns)
* Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy
* Infiltrative or metabolic cardiomyopathies (less typical but considered if features are atypical)

**Notes / uncertainty**

* Findings are **non-specific** and require integration with clinical history, ECG, and laboratory data
* Echocardiography defines functional patterns but **does not determine etiology**
* Overlap with other cardiomyopathies is common; additional imaging (e.g. CMR) or follow-up may be needed
* Severity and reversibility can vary depending on underlying cause and disease stage
