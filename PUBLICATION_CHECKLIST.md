## What to Commit

### ✅ Safe to Commit (Anonymized Data)
```
data/dataset_built/
├── documents.jsonl         # ✅ Anonymized metadata only
├── labels.csv              # ✅ Case IDs + diagnosis labels only
└── images/                 # ✅ Medical images (no PHI in pixels)
    └── <case_id>/
        └── frame_*.png
```

### ⛔ NEVER Commit (Sensitive)
```
data/raw_data/**/*.dcm      # ⛔ Original DICOM files
.env                        # ⛔ API keys
data/current_case_frames/   # ⛔ Temporary uploads
```

## Pre-Commit Verification

Run before each commit:

```bash
# 1. Verify no DICOM files staged
git status | grep -i "\.dcm"
# Expected: no output

# 2. Verify anonymization
python3 scripts/verify_anonymization.py
# Expected: ✅ All documents are properly anonymized!

# 3. Check .gitignore is working
git check-ignore data/raw_data/*.dcm
# Expected: lists all .dcm files (meaning they're ignored)
```

## GitHub Repository Settings

### Recommended Settings
1. **Branch Protection**:
   - Enable for `main` branch
   - Require PR reviews
   - Prevent force pushes

2. **Security**:
   - Enable Dependabot alerts
   - Enable secret scanning
   - Add `.env` to secret patterns

3. **Visibility**:
   - ✅ Public (safe with anonymized data)
   - Add license (e.g., MIT for research)

### GitHub Actions (Optional)

Create `.github/workflows/verify-anonymization.yml`:

```yaml
name: Verify Anonymization

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  verify:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.9'
      - run: python3 scripts/verify_anonymization.py
```

## Post-Publication Monitoring

### Regular Checks
- [ ] Monitor for accidental sensitive data commits
- [ ] Review GitHub Issues for privacy concerns
- [ ] Update anonymization if new data added
- [ ] Maintain verification script with codebase

### Contact for Privacy Issues

## Final Verification Before Push

```bash
# 1. Clean check
git status

# 2. Verify .gitignore working
git ls-files --others --ignored --exclude-standard | grep -i dcm
# Should list .dcm files as ignored

# 3. Final anonymization check
python3 scripts/verify_anonymization.py

# 4. Review what will be pushed
git diff --staged

# 5. Push if all clear
git push origin main
```
